# Predicting HK Stock movement with Linear Support Vector Classifier

Using Linear Support Vector Classification to analyze individual stock from Hong Kong
Data are downloaded from Yahoo Finance and Quandl
Data are processed directly by sklearn- machine learning algorithm
Stock quote can be changed at the end of it.
The classifier will provide a "Buy Signal" if the future stock price will rise for more than 3% with a pretty decent accuracy rate.

# New Version has been updated
Now, I have modified the python script for saving the classifier as a pickle to keep consistency and for training more stock.
I had also included a linear SVC classifier pre-trained with all the composite stock of Heng Seng Index.
